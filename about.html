            <p class="special">Jake Cvetas has been obsessed with avian creatures since 2009. Nesting Peregrine Falcons at the Evanston Public Library in his hometown sparked his curiosity. Birding has always been dear to his heart since it represents an escape from society and a chance to spend quality time with his father. He purchased his camera in late 2016, shooting with a Canon EOS 70D with a Canon EF Telephoto 300mm f/4.0L IS USM. At the age of 12, he was selected to be a part of a film on permanent display at the Field Museum of Natural History, linked below. </p>
